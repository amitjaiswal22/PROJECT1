                <h2>Missle Man of India</h2>
                <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in
                    the
                    pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State
                    of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his
                    mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims
                    back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the
                    youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy
                    Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his
                    ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s
                    and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal
                    Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had
                    involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as
                    ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order
                    to add to the family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914,
                    however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from
                    the ancestral home.[19][20][21]

                    In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student
                    who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.[21] After
                    completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to
                    attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from
                    where he graduated in physics in 1954.[22] He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering
                    in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean
                    was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the
                    project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who
                    later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".[23]
                    He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in
                    qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>
